## Personal Note

As a young boy, I spent countless hours immersed in fantasy games—battling wizards, exploring
magical worlds, and imagining heroic quests. Those early experiences sparked a lifelong love for 
storytelling and interactive gameplay. Now, as I transition into software engineering, I’ve had 
the joy of building one myself. Defeat the Evil Wizard is more than just a coding project—it’s a 
tribute to the games that inspired me and a milestone in my journey from player to creator.
